# Self-evaluation-paper
Code for paper "Self-evaluation of decision-making: A general Bayesian framework for metacognitive computation"
Fleming & Daw Psychological Review (in press)

This repo contains code used for the simulations in the paper. A preprint can be found here: http://metacoglab.org/s/FlemingDaw_selfEvaluation.pdf

**Scripts to reproduce figures**

These scripts also require functions inside the top-level folder, for instance computeMetaConf and computeFirstOrderConf

FlemingDaw_PsyRev_figure1, plots out example distributions underlying first- and second-order models

FlemingDaw_PsyRev_figure2, example plots of samples from second-order models

FlemingDaw_PsyRev_figure3, plots confidence in relation to stimulus strength separately for correct and incorrect decisions

FlemingDaw_PsyRev_figure4ABC - internal representations supporting error detection

FlemingDaw_PsyRev_figure4DE - heat map of how error awareness scales with different second-order model parameters

FlemingDaw_PsyRev_figure567 - rate/choose and choose/rate simulations

FlemingDaw_PsyRev_figure8 - modelling changes in metacognitive sensitivity

FlemingDaw_PsyRev_figure9 - modeling changes in metacognitive bias through mismatch of generative and inverse model parameters
